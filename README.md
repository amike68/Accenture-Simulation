Well we approached it in 5 steps:
1.	Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand the data in detail. So we took the time to understand the data model and domain of your business.
2.	Data cleaning - after understanding your business, we then cleaned the available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for this problem.
3.	Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, we needed to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the business questions and produce the results needed.
4.	Data analysis - With our new dataset, we used our analytical expertise to uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the insights.
5.	And finally we used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make recommendations on next steps.

As well as this, there were 1897 reactions from just the animal category alone! People obviously really like animals!

And also the most common month for users to post within was January. This aligns with seasonal trends of social media users that feel the need to reconnect with people after calendar events such as Christmas.

But now, onto the main question... which is... what were the top 5 most popular categories of posts?


From our analysis, you can see that the top 5 most popular categories of posts were animals, science, healthy eating, technology and food in descending order.

Animals had an aggregate popularity score of around 74965. It is very interesting to see both food and healthy eating within the top 5, it really shows that food is a highly engaging content category. Healthy eating ranks slightly higher than food, so perhaps your user base may be skewed towards healthy eaters and health-conscious people.
Finally, its also interesting to see science and technology too. This may suggest that people enjoy consuming factual content and snippets of content that they can learn something from.
Additionally, you can see from this chart the % split of popularity between the top 5 categories. There is not much difference between the share of each category, however, the difference between the 1st most popular, animals and the 2nd most popular, science, is the largest gap equal to 1.1%.
